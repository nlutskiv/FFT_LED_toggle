# FFT_LED_toggle
This project implements FFT using arduinoFFT.h to toggle 3 different LED's based on the pitch of the voice, recorded using an Electret Microphone Amplifier MAX4466 Module. 
============================================================================================================
1) The microphone with the MAX4466 Module is directly connected to the Analog pin for output (A0),  GRD & 3.3V DC source of an Arduino Uno R4.
2) 3 Different colour LED's are connected to the pins 2, 3, 4 with a GRD shared with the microphone throught a 500Ohm resistors.

3) Simple schematics can be viewed below.
